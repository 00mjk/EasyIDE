EasyIDE is an IDE for Mathematica, written in Mathematica.

***EasyIDE is in beta. Please make sure to commit your work frequently as I cannot yet be entirely certain that there will be no nasty state-losing bugs. I have written 90% of EasyIDE using the system itself, but I can only attest for my personal experience as its creator.***
